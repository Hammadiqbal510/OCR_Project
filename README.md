# Optical Character Recognition models

In these models images will be provided and model will recognise the text and try to predict the exact output.


Optical Character Recognition

OCR provides us with different ways to see an image, find and recognize the text in it. When we 
think about OCR, we inevitably think of lots of paperwork  - bank cheques and legal documents, text 
present in number  plate and street signs. In our case,  we will try to predict  the text of ID 
cards.  Optical  character  recognition  or  OCR  refers  to  a  set  of  computer  vision  
problems  that require us to convert images of digital or hand-written  text images to machine 
readable text in a form  your computer  can  process,  store  and  edit as a text file or as a part 
 of a data entry  and manipulation  software.
To recognize the text of CNIC, use two pretrained model:
1.   Easy OCR
2.   Tesseract OCR

1)  Easy OCR:

EasyOCR is implemented  using Python and the PyTorch  library. If you have a CUDA-capable GPU, the 
underlying PyTorch deep learning library can speed up your text detection and OCR speed 
tremendously.

As of this writing,  EasyOCR  can OCR text in 58 languages,  including English, German, Hindi, 
Russian, and more!

2)  Tesseract OCR:
Tesseract  is an open  source  text recognition  (OCR) Engine,  available under  the Apache  2.0 
license. It can be used directly, or (for programmers) using an API to extract printed text from 
images.  It supports  a wide  variety  of languages.  Tesseract  doesn't  have a built-in  GUI, but 
there  are  several  available  from  the  3rdParty  page.  Tesseract  is  compatible  with  many 
programming  languages and frameworks.  It can be used with the existing layout analysis to 
recognize text within a large document, or it can be used in conjunction with an external text 
detector  to  recognize  text  from  an image  of  a  single  text  line.  Before  applying  
pretrained model of OCR do image processing.





Image Processing:
Images  define  the  world,  each  image  has  its  own  story.  It  contains  a  lot  of  crucial 
information  that can be useful in many ways. This information can be obtained with the help  of  
the  technique  known  as  Image  Processing.  Image  processing  allows  us  to transform and 
manipulate thousands of images at a time and extract useful insights from them. It has a wide range 
of applications in almost every field.
For image processing use OpenCV, NumPy and PIL tool.

â€¢   OpenCV:
It stands for Open Source Computer Vision Library. This library consists of around 2000+ optimized 
algorithms that are useful for computer vision and machine learning.

â€¢    NumPy:
With this library you can also perform simple image techniques, such as flipping images, extracting 
features, and analyzing them.

Images  can be represented  by numpy  multi-dimensional arrays and so their type is ND Arrays. A 
color image is a numpy array with 3 dimensions. By slicing the multi-dimensional array the RGB 
channels can be separated.

â€¢   PIL tool:
It  stands  for  Python  Image  Library  and  Pillow  is the friendly  PIL fork  by Alex  Clark  
and Contributors. It's one of the powerful libraries. It supports a wide range of image formats 
like PPM, JPEG, TIFF, GIF, PNG, and BMP. It can help you perform several operations on images like 
rotating, resizing, cropping, grayscaling etc.

Comparison:
Easy OCR also recognize  the line while tesseract  is not. Easy OCR give the best result as compare 
 to tesseract.  In tesseract  it's show  special  character  and not recognize  all the character 
correctly do the spelling mistake more while Easy OCR shown all the string with correct spelling 
and not any special character is present.
Result:
Easy OCR is around 95% accurate while Tesseract is around 78.2% accurate.
